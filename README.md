# SuperImageSizeSaver
{OSSN COMPONENT} This component is for those wanting to only save storage on their servers and does not care much on quality but giving still a viewable image.
This reduces the image quality of the newly uploaded image to its 20% quality. This means that if the image uploaded is 10MB it could become 2MB.
